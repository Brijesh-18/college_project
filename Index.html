      <h3>WHAT IS HTML?</h3>
      <p>
        HTML is a markup language, so it uses simple tags to markup and format
        the content. These tags are enclosed in angular brackets like Almost all
        the tags have their closing tags also. The tag informs the browser that
        a HTML document has been started similarly tells the end of HTML
        document. All the things or code written inside these two tags are
        represented sent to the browser. The browsers then display the content
        wrapped inside the body tag.​HTML defines the format of how the web
        elements should be displayed. ​To see your content, you need to save
        your file with. html or.htm extension and then simply run it by choosing
        the option to open with any browser.​ HTML is one of the best options to
        develop a webpage or website for a small or growing business that does
        not want to invest more in purchasing software or its license and does
        not require any advanced programming for their websites.
